# WordPress Eclipse theme

WordPress development starter theme by (and mostly for) Nicolas Gillium, freelance web developer based in Nancy since 2014.

Largely inspired by themes such as [wd_s](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wd_s), [_s](https://github.com/Automattic/_s) 
and [air-light](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/air-light).

üéØ The aim is to provide a simple but effective development base for managing frontend dependencies.
